The first main creates a window with a red ball in it. This ball follows
the mouse, but stops when it gets to the edge. It also is able to be clicked. I went
through and commented any line that was not explained. Main 2 is almost the same, but 
moves the ball with keyboard input rather than mouse. I went through the same process in 
this file.
